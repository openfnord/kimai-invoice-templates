## Installation

If not existing, create the directory `var/invoices/` in your Kimai installation.

```
cd /var/www/kimai/var/
mkdir invoices
```

Then copy the files from any subdirectory into this new directory (`/var/www/kimai/var/invoices/`).

They should show now up in your "Invoice templates" administration, in the **"Invoice document"** dropdown.

Please read the official documentation at [https://www.kimai.org/documentation/invoices.html](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/invoices.html) to find out more about building your own invoice templates.
